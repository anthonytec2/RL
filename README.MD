## Reinforcement Learning Repository
This repository is designated to some reinforcement learning research that I am performing. I will include some tutorial notebooks on the work that I am trying to perform. Thus far I am playing around with the cart pole example and testing out different algorithms for this example. All of this research will be based off the [Open AI Gym environment](https://gym.openai.com/).
